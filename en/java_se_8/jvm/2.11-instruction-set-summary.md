#### **2.11 Instruction Set Summary** 

A Java Virtual Machine instruction consists of a one-byte *opcode* specifying the operation to be performed, followed by zero or more *operands* supplying arguments or data that are used by the operation. Many instructions have no operands and consist only of an opcode. 

Ignoring exceptions, the inner loop of a Java Virtual Machine interpreter is effectively 

```java
   do {
       atomically calculate pc and fetch opcode at pc;
       if (operands) fetch operands;
       execute the action for the opcode;
   } while (there is more to do);
```

The number and size of the operands are determined by the opcode. If an operand is more than one byte in size, then it is stored in *big-endian* order - high-order byte first. For example, an unsigned 16-bit index into the local variables is stored as two unsigned bytes, *byte1* and *byte2*, such that its value is (*byte1* << 8) | *byte2*. 

The bytecode instruction stream is only single-byte aligned. The two exceptions are the *lookupswitch* and *tableswitch* instructions (ยง*lookupswitch*, ยง*tableswitch*), which are padded to force internal alignment of some of their operands on 4-byte boundaries. 

> The decision to limit the Java Virtual Machine opcode to a byte and to forgo data alignment within compiled code reflects a conscious bias in favor of compactness, possibly at the cost of some performance in naive implementations. A one-byte opcode also limits the size of the instruction set. Not assuming data alignment means that immediate data larger than a byte must be constructed from bytes at run time on many machines.
