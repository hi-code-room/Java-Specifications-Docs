#### **2.6.5 Abrupt Method Invocation Completion** 

A method invocation *completes abruptly* if execution of a Java Virtual Machine instruction within the method causes the Java Virtual Machine to throw an exception (ยง2.10), and that exception is not handled within the method. Execution of an *athrow* instruction (ยง*athrow*) also causes an exception to be explicitly thrown and, if the exception is not caught by the current method, results in abrupt method invocation completion. A method invocation that completes abruptly never returns a value to its invoker.
