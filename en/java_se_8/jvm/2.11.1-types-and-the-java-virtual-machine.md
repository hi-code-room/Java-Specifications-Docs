#### **2.11.1 Types and the Java Virtual Machine** 

Most of the instructions in the Java Virtual Machine instruction set encode type information about the operations they perform. For instance, the *iload* instruction (ยง*iload*) loads the contents of a local variable, which must be an int, onto the operand stack. The *fload* instruction (ยง*fload*) does the same with a float value. The two instructions may have identical implementations, but have distinct opcodes. 

For the majority of typed instructions, the instruction type is represented explicitly in the opcode mnemonic by a letter: *i* for an int operation, *l* for long, *s* for short, *b* for byte, *c* for char, *f* for float, *d* for double, and *a* for reference. Some instructions for which the type is unambiguous do not have a type letter in their mnemonic. For instance, *arraylength* always operates on an object that is an array. Some instructions, such as *goto*, an unconditional control transfer, do not operate on typed operands. 

Given the Java Virtual Machine's one-byte opcode size, encoding types into opcodes places pressure on the design of its instruction set. If each typed instruction supported all of the Java Virtual Machine's run-time data types, there would be more instructions than could be represented in a byte. Instead, the instruction set of the Java Virtual Machine provides a reduced level of type support for certain operations. In other words, the instruction set is intentionally not orthogonal. Separate instructions can be used to convert between unsupported and supported data types as necessary. 

Table 2.11.1-A summarizes the type support in the instruction set of the Java Virtual Machine. A specific instruction, with type information, is built by replacing the *T* in the instruction template in the opcode column by the letter in the type column. If the type column for some instruction template and type is blank, then no instruction exists supporting that type of operation. For instance, there is a load instruction for type int, *iload*, but there is no load instruction for type byte. 

Note that most instructions in Table 2.11.1-A do not have forms for the integral types byte, char, and short. None have forms for the boolean type. A compiler encodes loads of literal values of types byte and short using Java Virtual Machine instructions that sign-extend those values to values of type int at compile-time or run-time. Loads of literal values of types boolean and char are encoded using instructions that zero-extend the literal to a value of type int at compile-time or run-time. Likewise, loads from arrays of values of type boolean, byte, short, and char are encoded using Java Virtual Machine instructions that sign-extend or zero- extend the values to values of type int. Thus, most operations on values of actual types boolean, byte, char, and short are correctly performed by instructions operating on values of computational type int.

The mapping between Java Virtual Machine actual types and Java Virtual Machine computational types is summarized by Table 2.11.1-B. 

Certain Java Virtual Machine instructions such as *pop* and *swap* operate on the operand stack without regard to type; however, such instructions are constrained to use only on values of certain categories of computational types, also given in Table 2.11.1-B.
