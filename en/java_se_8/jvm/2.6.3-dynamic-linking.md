#### **2.6.3 Dynamic Linking** 

Each frame (ยง2.6) contains a reference to the run-time constant pool (ยง2.5.5) for the type of the current method to support *dynamic linking* of the method code. The class file code for a method refers to methods to be invoked and variables to be accessed via symbolic references. Dynamic linking translates these symbolic method references into concrete method references, loading classes as necessary to resolve as-yet-undefined symbols, and translates variable accesses into appropriate offsets in storage structures associated with the run-time location of these variables. 

This late binding of the methods and variables makes changes in other classes that a method uses less likely to break this code.
