#### **2.3.3 The** returnAddress **Type and Values** 

The returnAddress type is used by the Java Virtual Machine's *jsr*, *ret*, and *jsr_w* instructions (ยง*jsr*, ยง*ret*, ยง*jsr_w*). 
The values of the returnAddress type are pointers to the opcodes of Java Virtual Machine instructions. Unlike the numeric 
primitive types, the returnAddress type does not correspond to any Java programming language type and cannot be modified 
by the running program.
