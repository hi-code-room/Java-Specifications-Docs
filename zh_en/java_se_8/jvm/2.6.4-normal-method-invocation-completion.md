#### **2.6.4 Normal Method Invocation Completion** 

A method invocation *completes normally* if that invocation does not cause an exception (ยง2.10) to be thrown, either directly from the Java Virtual Machine or as a result of executing an explicit throw statement. If the invocation of the current method completes normally, then a value may be returned to the invoking method. This occurs when the invoked method executes one of the return instructions (ยง2.11.8), the choice of which must be appropriate for the type of the value being returned (if any). 

The current frame (ยง2.6) is used in this case to restore the state of the invoker, including its local variables and operand stack, with the program counter of the invoker appropriately incremented to skip past the method invocation instruction. Execution then continues normally in the invoking method's frame with the returned value (if any) pushed onto the operand stack of that frame.
