#### **2.7 Representation of Objects** 

The Java Virtual Machine does not mandate any particular internal structure for objects. 

> In some of Oracleâ€™s implementations of the Java Virtual Machine, a reference to a class instance is a pointer to a *handle* that is itself a pair of pointers: one to a table containing the methods of the object and a pointer to the Class object that represents the type of the object, and the other to the memory allocated from the heap for the object data.
