#### 3.11 **Operations on the Operand Stack** 

The Java Virtual Machine has a large complement of instructions that manipulate the contents of the operand stack as untyped values. These are useful because of the Java Virtual Machine's reliance on deft manipulation of its operand stack. For instance: 

```java
public long nextIndex() {
	return index++;
}

private long index = 0;
```

is compiled to: 

```
Method long nextIndex()
0 aload_0					// Push this
1 dup							// Make a copy of it
2 getfield #4			// One of the copies of this is consumed
									// pushing long field index,
									// above the original this
5 dup2_x1					// The long on top of the operand stack is
									// inserted into the operand stack below the
									// original this
6 lconst_1				// Push long constant 1
7 ladd						// The index value is incremented...
8 putfield #4			// ...and the result stored in the field
11 lreturn				// The original value of index is on top of
									// the operand stack, ready to be returned
```

Note that the Java Virtual Machine never allows its operand stack manipulation instructions to modify or break up individual values on the operand stack.
