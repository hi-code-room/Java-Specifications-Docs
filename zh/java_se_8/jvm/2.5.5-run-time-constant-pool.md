#### **2.5.5 Run-Time Constant Pool** 

A *run-time constant pool* is a per-class or per-interface run-time representation of the constant_pool table in a class file (ยง4.4). It contains several kinds of constants, ranging from numeric literals known at compile-time to method and field references that must be resolved at run-time. The run-time constant pool serves a function similar to that of a symbol table for a conventional programming language, although it contains a wider range of data than a typical symbol table. 

Each run-time constant pool is allocated from the Java Virtual Machine's method area (ยง2.5.4). The run-time constant pool for a class or interface is constructed when the class or interface is created (ยง5.3) by the Java Virtual Machine. 

The following exceptional condition is associated with the construction of the run- time constant pool for a class or interface: 

- When creating a class or interface, if the construction of the run-time constant pool requires more memory than can be made available in the method area of the Java Virtual Machine, the Java Virtual Machine throws an OutOfMemoryError. 

> See ยง5 (*Loading, Linking, and Initializing*) for information about the construction of the run-time constant pool.
