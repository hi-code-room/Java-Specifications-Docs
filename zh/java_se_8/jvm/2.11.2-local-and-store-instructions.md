#### **2.11.2 Load and Store Instructions** 

The load and store instructions transfer values between the local variables (§2.6.1) and the operand stack (§2.6.2) of a Java Virtual Machine frame (§2.6): 

- Load a local variable onto the operand stack: *iload*, *iload_*, *lload*, *lload_*, *fload*, *fload_*, *dload*, *dload_*, *aload*, *aload_*. 
- Store a value from the operand stack into a local variable: *istore*, *istore_*, *lstore*, *lstore_*, *fstore*, *fstore_*, *dstore*, *dstore_*, *astore*, *astore_*. 
- Load a constant on to the operand stack: *bipush*, *sipush*, *ldc*, *ldc_w*, *ldc2_w*, *aconst_null*, *iconst_m1*, *iconst_*, *lconst_*, *fconst_*, *dconst_*.

Instructions that access fields of objects and elements of arrays (§2.11.5) also transfer data to and from the operand stack. 

Instruction mnemonics shown above with trailing letters between angle brackets (for instance, *iload_*) denote families of instructions (with members *iload_0*, *iload_1*, *iload_2*, and *iload_3* in the case of *iload_*). Such families of instructions are specializations of an additional generic instruction (*iload*) that takes one operand. For the specialized instructions, the operand is implicit and does not need to be stored or fetched. The semantics are otherwise the same (*iload_0* means the same thing as *iload* with the operand *0*). The letter between the angle brackets specifies the type of the implicit operand for that family of instructions: for **, a nonnegative integer; for **, an int; for **, a long; for **, a float; and for **, a double. Forms for type int are used in many cases to perform operations on values of type byte, char, and short (§2.11.1). 

This notation for instruction families is used throughout this specification.
