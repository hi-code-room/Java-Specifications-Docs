#### 2.1 The class File Format

Compiled code to be executed by the Java Virtual Machine is represented using a hardware- and operating system-independent 
binary format, typically (but not necessarily) stored in a file, known as the class file format. The class file format 
precisely defines the representation of a class or interface, including details such as byte ordering that might be taken 
for granted in a platform-specific object file format.

Chapter 4, "The class File Format", covers the class file format in detail.
