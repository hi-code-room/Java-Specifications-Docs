#### 3.6 **Receiving Arguments** 

If *n* arguments are passed to an instance method, they are received, by convention, in the local variables numbered *1* through *n* of the frame created for the new method invocation. The arguments are received in the order they were passed. For example: 

```java
int addTwo(int i, int j) {
	return i + j;
}
```

compiles to: 

```
Method int addTwo(int,int)
0 iload_1		// Push
1 iload_2		// Push
2 iadd			// Add; leave int result on operand stack
3 ireturn		// Return int result
```

By convention, an instance method is passed a reference to its instance in local variable *0*. In the Java programming language the instance is accessible via the this keyword. 

Class (static) methods do not have an instance, so for them this use of local variable *0* is unnecessary. A class method starts using local variables at index *0*. If the addTwo method were a class method, its arguments would be passed in a similar way to the first version: 

```java
static int addTwoStatic(int i, int j) {
	return i + j;
}
```

compiles to: 

```
Method int addTwoStatic(int,int) 
0 iload_0
1 iload_1
2 iadd
3 ireturn
```

The only difference is that the method arguments appear starting in local variable *0* rather than *1*.
